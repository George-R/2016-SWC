		Babe Ruth entered the MLB on 11 July 1914, bought by the Boston Red Sox from the Baltimore Orioles, who at the time were a minor league team.
				He began his career as a pitcher, leading the Boston Red Sox to two World Series titles as an outstanding southpaw.
				In the 1919 season, Ruth insisted he wanted to play every day and was moved to the outfield. One year later he was traded to the New York Yankess, leadin to an 86 year title drought in Boston that became known as the Curse of the Bambino.
